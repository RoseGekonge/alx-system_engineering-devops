1. First, I opened command prompt.
2. I navigated to the folder with my png files
3. I then used the command sftp username@hostname to establish a sftp connection
4. Then I created the command_line_for_the_win directory in alx_system_engineering-devops
5. Thats where I added the png files using the command 'put 2-next_9_tasks.png'. The same was done to the other two png files.
6. After the files were made, I used the exit command to stop the connection
